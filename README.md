# Article Management System  

This **Java-based Article Management System** efficiently manages media articles for an online shop. Users can **add, delete, list, and analyze** books and DVDs while ensuring **persistent storage** through **Java Object Serialization**.  

## Features  
- **Add Articles** – Store books and DVDs with relevant details.  
- **List Articles** – Display stored articles with calculated discounts.  
- **Retrieve Articles** – Fetch details using an article ID.  
- **Delete Articles** – Remove an article by ID.  
- **Statistics & Insights** – Count total articles, determine mean price, and find the oldest article(s).  
- **Persistent Storage** – Ensures data retention using **Java Serialization**.  
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – User-friendly interaction via terminal commands.

## Key Concepts Learned  
- **Java File Serialization** – Enables object persistence between program runs.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Implemented core principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- **Abstract Classes & Inheritance** – Structured class hierarchy for reusable and scalable code.  
- **Polymorphism** – Enabled flexible method behavior across different article types.  
- **Exception Handling** – Ensured robust error management for invalid input and system failures.  
- **Interfaces & Dependency Injection** – Improved modularity by separating data access logic.  
- **File Handling** – Utilized serialization for efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Provided interactive user input processing.  
- **Data Processing & Formatting** – Standardized price display and applied discounts dynamically.
